Who am I?

Iâ€™m currently a Game Programming Specialist at Paradox Interactive in Stockholm, Sweden. I basically help the company as an internal consultant for the technical area in video-games. Previously I worked in many Programming roles in Brazil and in Ireland. The last one was as Lead Game Programmer at Black Shamrock Studios in Dublin, Ireland. I had the opportunity to work in franchises such as Blood Bowl and Paranoia before joining Paradox. Check my LinkedIn link on the left bar if you wish to know more things about my professional life.

In my spare time, I love to do photographs, travel, practice kendo and play some musical instruments including Ukulele and Drums.
